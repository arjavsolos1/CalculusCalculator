The code contains functionality to compute all types of Riemann sums (left, right, and midpoint), limit approximations, and derivatives using the power rule, quotient rule,
and product rule. The calculator processes user input to automatically solve problems related to rate of change, areas under curves, and limits. The algorithm is designed to
handle multiple calculus concepts, efficiently breaking down functions and applying appropriate rules for accurate solutions across a variety of calculus problems.
